An open source (licensed with GPL 2.0 and above) Java-program to do polyphonic pitch detection from standard audio in (uses the default audio in with 16-bit mono at 44100 Hz, modify Capture.java to suit your setup).

The project is an attempt to implement the polyphonic pitch detection method described in Anssi Klapuri's (list of publications http://www.cs.tut.fi/~klap/iiro/ and http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/people/anssik/publications.htm) congress publication

The current version needs to be restarted sometimes in order to initiate the sound capture (could be specific to my latop and operating system). The current version is able to detect two notes from my electric guitar consistently. I am not likely to improve the implementation substantially, unless I notice some bugs.  

I started the project with the hopes of implementing polyphonic pitch detection to be used in a Frets of Fire/Guitar Hero type game by pluggin an actual electric guitar into the audio in. Also, tuning guitar with polyphonic pitch detection would be pretty nifty (http://www.tcelectronic.com/polytune.asp), or the pitch detection could be used for off-line transcription. The current version has a massive lag on my HP mini laptop, which makes it unsuitable for real-time stuff.
